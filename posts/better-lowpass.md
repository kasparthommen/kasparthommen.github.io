# A Better Exponential Smoothing Filter

If you are familiar with statistics, electronics or
[DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing), you may
have heard of one of the following terms:
- Exponential moving average (EMA)
- Exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA)
- RC filter
- First-order lowpass filter

I will stick the last one on the list from now on. The
[Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform)
[transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function) of such a filter is

$$H(s) = dd$$
